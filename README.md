# Unofficial University of Saskatchewan Degree Program Requirements Scraper

Scrapes usask.ca for all publicly available requirements in any or all degree programs.

:construction: Currently this scraper does not parse course prerequisite information.

## Background

Current web-based tools from the university don't assist students with
making wise, self-guided decisions about their education planning,
such as preparing to meet all course prerequisites efficiently, 
or to optimize the value of their time spent earning multiple degrees.

I'm currently in need of some perspective in this area, and I see the opportunity
to solve this problem for myself and others in the same situation.

## Development Goal

Future versions will build a course dependency tree to help with degree program planning,
by allowing users to see the path through prerequisites to any course,
and the overlapping courses amongst offered programs.

## Far Future Goal

To tie in ontological outlines gathered from:

* course syllabi
* textbooks, lab manuals and other course materials
* as yet unanticipated sources

Attempt to provide a more comprehensive mapping of knowledge in a mental framework
that first-time students can use to their advantage.
